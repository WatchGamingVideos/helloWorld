helloWorld is an app that allows the user to find out how to say hello in every country in the world in its major languages
and a few facts about each country (the capital, major languages and the continent on which it is located).

The project was created using a JSON (created by the developer, Tolu, along with the online resource getCountries()
(http://peric.github.io/GetCountries/).

The project uses the unsplash API to load a unique background on each load, all tagged with the themeword "nature".

The project also uses the flickr API to load images using AJAX whenever a new country is selected, displaying images tagged
with the selected country name.

The project is styled with bootstrap.

The JSON was parsed using JS.
